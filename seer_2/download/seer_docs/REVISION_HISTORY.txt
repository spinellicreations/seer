REVISION HISTORY

ENTRY	NAME		V		REV	NOTES
-----	----		-		---	-----

0	S.E.E.R.	0.0 - 3.x	n/a	All copies and information lost due
						to data storage failure and lack
						of backups (ya, that's what I said).

1	S.E.E.R. 2	4.0		n/a	Based wholly on a few principles:
							- integration with mod_openopc
							- built for and with:
								apache 2+
								php5+
								mysql 5+
								mod_openopc_2 3+
							- the previous S.E.E.R. which
							  took much of its structure
							  and php / sql i/o functionality
							  from existing SpinelliCreations
							  and / or SorrentoLactalis work.

						Version codename is: Brahma Bull
							- much an angry reaction
							  to negligence which lead up
							  to the destruction of the first
							  S.E.E.R.
							- indicates a strong dominance
							  and superiority (with regard to
							  ability of customization and
							  functionality) within the field.
							- shal be retained through the
							  the 4.x-x series of builds.

						The idea here is to have an even more
						generalized skeleton system that is
						eaiser to deploy than the previous, not
						that the previous was bad (had we not 
						lost it, we would have never considered
						rebuilding, but, since we have to anyway,
						might as well apply what we've learned...)

2	S.E.E.R. 2	4.19		n/a	PRE-Release, missing language files and 
	SVN_SNAPSHOT_2010_0524			documentation.  Otherwise, complete.

3	S.E.E.R. 2	4.19		1	bugfix for above, SPFMODEL Production
	SVN_SNAPSHOT_2010_0614			Analysis Report was missing detail 
						rundown for section "Pick up straggler
						records".

4	S.E.E.R. 2	4.20		n/a	cleanup of prerelease... daylight savings time
						warning is now in bold red instead of page
						font / color to be more noticeable, temperature
						charts with black filler (fix for IE fucking up
						table cell widths with background images having
						superimposed graphics) changed to white filler
						(looks better, more like it's not a 'fix' and
						'should' be that way), csv's cleaned up to be
						more like the actual reports themselves.

5	S.E.E.R. 2	4.20		1	cleanup is complete and also added an export
						age sanity check.  In the event a user closes
						their browser after viewing an export, without
						first navigating to another page, then the export
						is orphaned.  Orphans are auto-checked for each
						time subsequent exports are run by any user...
						if orphans are found and are more than 1 hour old,
						then they are deleted automagically.  

6	S.E.E.R. 2	4.30		n/a	authoring of the W.A.R.R.I.O.R. module for
						Overall Equipment Efficiency, in line with what
						is detailed by Wikipedia on the topic.
						-- Workplace Authenticated Resource Runtime
							Input and Output Report.
						Determined that the reason the 'heavy analysis' 
						reports (like Tankmodel Occupancy Report) take
						such a very long time is not anything to do with
						php's array cycling functionality (as was previously
						thought to be the limiting factor), but rather with
						disk-to-memory I/O.  For example, you can run a
						MySQL examine query, which will tell you how long
						the database takes to determine what you want, put
						it in the right order, and get ready to actually
						send you the data... that happens almost instantly
						(less than 5 seconds on even the most brutal queries)
						but then if you run the same query from the sql 
						console without the 'explain' flag (thus making it
						throw all that data up on the terminal screen)
						it can take 3, 4, 5 or more minutes depending on
						the query.  To further back it up, if you only
						select one or two fields instead of all columns, 
						the response time scales perfectly... 
							response = (col selected / total cols) * (total col query time)
						So what's the fix?  Really isn't one... it's not broken.
						To help though (and its helped a lot), went through all
						of the reports and hmi's and determined exactly what
						columns are needed for each query, then set to select
						only those... there are very few "select *" statements
						left, and those are only where all columns are used.
						If you want better performance, then you've got to
						increase the minimum hardware specification.
						-- key hardware pieces are as follows:
						-- -- System Memory Size (go up to 64 GB and increase
								innodb memory size from 18 to 40 in my.conf)
						-- -- Processor Speed (go up to 4 dual core Santa Ana/Rosa 
								Opterons at 3.2 GHz or two W5590 Xeon at
								3.3 GHz.
						
						

7	S.E.E.R. 2	4.31		n/a	WARRIOR module is complete.  I imagine sorrento and
						LAG IT are going to want a custom schedule updater for
						WARRIOR to integrate with their new labeling system,
						which is all fine and well, but that'll come later,
						the module itself is done.  The CheckWeigher Model is
						also done.  syphon was upgraded to include a new 
						subroutine specifically to dump scale data into a
						mod_openopc database for use with SEER and the 
						CheckWeigher model.
						-- THIS VERSION SHALL BE A PUBLIC PRE-RELEASE ALSO.

8	S.E.E.R. 2	4.32		n/a	ATMOSPHERIC model complete for display and logging
						of temperature / humidity / atmospheric pressure of
						a given environmental zone.

9	S.E.E.R. 2	4.33		n/a	Training Portal / Documents / etc. stripped from SEER.
						The ultimate purpose of SEER does not need these items.
						I felt we were getting out of the scope of the package,
						and trying to tackle something different.  So it's gone
						as of 4.33 (2010-11-16).

10	S.E.E.R. 2	4.34		n/a	apparently MSIE-6 throws a problem at us.  The php
						header instruction 'refresh' is unavailable until
						MSIE-7, and since we are trying to go as far back
						as 6 compatability, we will have to re-use the
						deprecated META REFRESH tags instead of the more 
						elegant and semi-standard php header 'refresh', actually,
						we'll end up with an option to use either-or-both.
						added level in percent (display, not plot) and product name
						to the TANKMODEL REPORT 1 - TEMPERATURE CHART report page.

11	S.E.E.R. 2	4.34		1	added SCHEDULE NUMBER, PACKAGE CLASS, JOB DESCRIPTION, and
						OPERATOR OR TRADESMAN to the WARRIOR OEE/TEEP report for
						clarity.

12	S.E.E.R. 2	4.34		2	'no-peeking' subdirectory auto-redirect to primary index
						used the php header 'refresh' method -- changed to php
						header 'location' method which is fully standardized across
						browsers.

13	S.E.E.R. 2	4.34		3	bugfixes for the runaway decimal point in checkweigher report 0,
						rounding error reduced to 0.01% for standard deviation plots,
						same done for atmospheric model std dev plots.  warrior report 2
						uses a header now for indicating user / product / schedule / etc.
						being run on a line when a group of errors occur, which are 
						displayed based upon duration and the detail level requested
						by the user.

14	S.E.E.R. 2	4.35		n/a	massive consolidation of scripts - pulled all of the HMI and
						REPORT scripts out, added traffic_cop_option_negotiation to
						handle it all and direct immediately to the BODY portions.
						Pulled all of the createdb scripts out and replaced them
						with mod_openopc_setup_createdb_negotiation to work in
						conjunction with model advanced_options files.  All model
						actions moved to ./include/core_models so as to keep the frame
						work separate from the model actions.

						What is left is to clean up the model actions / scripts themselves
						and make sure that they pretty print.  The outer framework is
						already checked and assured to pretty print and as far as I can
						tell it is sound (and now consolidated).

15	S.E.E.R. 2	4.35		1	bugfix for 4.35 - once 'restrict by department' functionality 
						was added, maintenance department members (who we want to
						view everything, were also restricted... woops!)  fixed this
						by adding declaration to global options file of "what term
						is used for the name of your maintenance dept".

						checkweigher model had some tags missing on report 0 (analysis)
						specifically for taking the percentage of the giveaway/takeaway
						and putting it next to the mass - the calculation was there
						but it displayed only on the last record not all records.

16	S.E.E.R. 2	4.36		n/a	checkweigher model upgraded to version 2 (codename Leda),
						and set to include the machine operator in both the live
						hmi's and the historical reports.  note, this required an
						update to syphon (so as of s.e.e.r. 4.36 - build 16, syphon
						version 0.1-6 is required).

17	S.E.E.R. 2	4.37		RC1	continue the fuctional subroutine port of everything that didn't
						get pushed in the last cleanup... which means all of the core 
						model stuff.  also fixed an issue with table display alignment
						on the system info page.  settings page finally makes some 
						sense, and it functions properly.  tons of html formatting
						cleanup to force 'pretty print' of exported markup to browsers.
						all forms now proper, and all generated pages validate with
						the w3c validation checker for html 4.01 transitional.  
						consolidated a lot of model functions into just that - functions,
						rather than having them repeated in printed code.  functions
						common to multiple models are shared, and all reports / hmi's 
						share common structure, user input methods, and such, lending
						to a more refined feel.  the main improvement is the ability
						to perform global changes - as roughly 60% of the model codebase
						is now shared functions.  this will also lend itself to ease
						of adding more models in the future, as the bulk of the work
						is already done, and you can just call little functions 
						to do what you need.

						And - FINALLY - stripped the Lactalis branding out of it, and
						it a GNU Licensed image (the SEER Logo without any proprietary
						art) for the default image / created a default globaloptions_seer_0
						file that does not include any proprietary information.

						note - this is the first non-subversion (completed,
						       as in 'ready for prime time') public release.

18	S.E.E.R. 2	4.37		RC2	fixes since RC1...
							-- addusers insertion query syntax error
							-- removeusers results display poorly formatted
							-- settings page would throw query fault due to 
							   model queries for CHECKWEIGHER and WARRIOR on initial
							   setup (first run) because their interaction tables did
							   not yet exist.
							-- WARRIOR schedule table population failed due to 
							   missing variable declaration in core_user_active_or_dead()
							   function.
							ALL OF THE ABOVE ARE REPAIRED

19	S.E.E.R. 2	1.4.37		RC2	little bit of documentation tidy-up, bugfixes to WARRIOR report 2
						and massive improvements to report 0, 1, and 2 overall.  

20	S.E.E.R. 2	1.4.37		RC3	added integration for a labeling plugin to be used (we wrote the
						lactalis_bartender_labeling_plugin which is proprietary and will
						not be included in SEER releases, however the principles behind it
						as far as 'where it injects itself into the basecode' and 'where it
						needs to show up in the hmi screens' would be similar for any label
						application seeking integration with SEER (WARRIOR).  so that's in
						there.

21	S.E.E.R. 2	1.4.37		RC4	appearance fix for WARRIOR report[0] and some addition of option
						for 'SLOW BOUNCEBACK' in globaloptions_WARRIOR_0, to allow syncing
						the SLOW_BOUNCEBACK time in seconds to the mod_openopc READ routine
						scantime.  added WARRIOR operatior guide, along with Allen Bradley
						PLC logic file templates for the WARRIOR module in both Controllogix
						and SLC / uLogix format.

22	S.E.E.R. 2	1.4.37		FINAL	final tweaks and such.
						-- bugfix to WARRIOR report 2 (downtime analysis) where individual
						machine instances of run / down / or scheduled down which had 
						already been sorted by critical points (primarily job / schedule / 
						package_class / operator / etc...) were now being re-evaluated and
						'chopped' because of this re-evaluation.  Problem was using the 
						same 'scrutinize_history' function that used to be (and I believe
						still is) a part of the hmi_0 machine_control page.  In that
						instance, we want to truncate history based on these minor changes.
						However, for our overall report, we do NOT want to do this - as, 
						stated already, it's pre-sorted.
						-- some more little stuff to make sure labeling_system plugins
						work properly.
						-- creation of the THINCHART module for quick-and-easy replacement
						of standard 3 pen + 1 event pen circular chart recorders with
						SEER monitoring.

23	S.E.E.R. 2	1.4.37		FINAL	added ability to execute plugins in 3 areas... the html header,
						prior to main body processing, and in post-processing (after
						all markup is generated, allowing you to modify that markup).
						-- misc. other cleanup.
						-- license cleanup.

						v.1.4.37 FINAL --- DONE!


	-----------------------------------------------------------------
	-----------------------------------------------------------------
	NOTE
	-----------------------------------------------------------------
	-----------------------------------------------------------------
	1.4.37 FINAL (build 23) is the first 'Long Term Stability' public
	release, and is a freeze of the 1.4 series.
	-----------------------------------------------------------------
	-----------------------------------------------------------------


24	S.E.E.R. 2	1.5.0		n/a	added user browser (browser name / engine id / and version id)
						to the base system, and now it'll show up on at the top of the
						page.  allows plugins or anything else to do some 'engine-based'
						tricks in order to ensure proper operation.  this is not intended
						to be used at the 'browser name' or 'version number' level, as
						that is too finnicky and we like broad reaching cross compatability,
						but some minor tweaks based on engine is understandable.
						
24.5	S.E.E.R. 2	1.5.1		n/a	added display of active THEME and active PLUGINS to the top of
						the page where 'active user' / 'browser info' and other stuff is.

						added absolute path appending to the front of auto-refresh
						uri's on the local server which are absolute or relative to the
						server, rather than whole 'http://such-and-such.....' requests.
						this will aid in ensuring compatability with the instruction.

						fixed potential issue - when ceritfying records (for any model),
						the user 'comment' was not sanitized.  the result was that the
						use could push back " ' ", " \ ", or other potentially nefarious
						characters in their comment, resulting in failure to update
						the records.  value is now sanitized.

						added some language entries for labeling plugins and for
						static "auto" and "manual"

						fixed small but 'effectively massive' bug in WARRIOR - the 
						ability to run reports against just a certain 'shift', or over
						just the selected hours of a series of days - that ability 
						creates a hole that has to be dealt with.  to do so, individual
						run instances are identified, separated, and then put back
						together (in a manner of speaking, after the non-desired time
						frames are removed), and then all the calculations begin. a while
						back, there was a fix to report 01 and 02 to address this, but it was
						not typed properly into report 00.  it has now been fixed on report
						00 too.

						added ability to turn 'on' or 'off' labeling plugin integration
						on a per-local-options group basis.  for example, you can globally
						enable labeling plugin integration, and then turn it 'on' for
						items in warrior local options group 0, 1, and 4 - but also have it
						turned off for items in local options group 2 and 3 - yielding
						greater overall system flexibility.

						functionalized a 'fudged' version of mod_openopc_write_declared, to
						allow in-stream creation of daemon event files.

25	S.E.E.R. 2	1.5.2		n/a	added generic backdrop / framework screen... this can be used
						to display new_target_window links that do not require navitation
						away from the user's current control page.  rather, the user can
						press a link, and open a pop up (well, a new window actually, or
						depending on browser it may show up as a new tab) that will 
						have a generic seer header and footer, along with whatever
						dynamic content is sent to the body.  this is ideal for things
						such as "click here to view LARGE image" or "click here to view
						the graph in LARGE size" - where just the content is displayed,
						and no other control is granted.  the user is then expected to
						close the pop up (other window / tab) and return to regular 
						control page to proceed further on.

						This new feature is called "PopUP Canvas", and its first 
						application has been to all Gantt Charts.  These now display
						in reports with a button to show the PopUP Canvas for Precision
						Viewing at a window size of around 2500 pixels (in comparison to
						normal 900 pixel constraint).  This results in effectively a 
						500% scale factor for the Gantt chart itself.

						Added functionality to the datestampAddtime function... it now
						supports the adding of 'seconds' (so resolution for addition is
						down to the second, not just the minute).

						Added export functionality for PDF files.  Now, any report from
						the "Reporting" Tab can be exported as an exact copy in PDF
						format for uncontrolled document archival or sharing.

						---- ya, that whole PDF thing - it works great - but wayyyy
						more work that I thought it would be.  Fkin' eh!

26	S.E.E.R. 2	1.5.2		a	added support for server-supplied fonts via CSS.  This gets
						rid of any issue with layout or text width in just about every
						modern browser.  The CSS implementation is far from ideal, but
						until open web fonts gain wide use, it does fall in line with
						what is the accepted practice currently.  Support for Trident,
						WebKit, Mozilla, Presto, and KDE engines is present.  Also
						fixes issue from 1.5.2 (build 25) where PDF's would print with
						sometimes screwed up text being cut off at ends of cells (due to
						WebKit browser not using 'ideal' font, which now we just push
						the font we want).

27	S.E.E.R. 2	1.5.2		b	bugfix for the tele-hack-ahead plugin's replacement of
						'select' form field markup when used in conjunction with
						export to PDF.
						
						$THA_new_html_form_select_open went from using escaped
						double quotes within the variable to using just standard
						single quotes, which shouldn't be an issue primarily because
						it's a function / script reference, not a file reference.

28	S.E.E.R. 2	1.5.2		c	bugfixes for WARRIOR module.  

						-- Scheduled Down versus Down time was not being computed
						properly for the "Availability" variable.  It was computing
						Run time versus Total time, rather than Run Time versus 
						(Total Time -minus- Not Scheduled Time).  Fixed.

						-- Corrective actions were not back-tracking properly.  If
						going from an instance of downtime with an alarm and
						corrective action, which qualified as Scheduled Downtime, to
						a preceding instance with alarm and no corrective action
						(which, on its own, would qualify as Downtime), the corrective
						action was not being back-tracked onto the preceding instance.
						... result was that (for example) an operator is down 20 minutes,
						and 2 minutes before he resumes running, he enters corrective
						action.  This action would not be applied to the previous 18
						minutes (which it -SHOULD- be applied to!).

						-- for long running instances of Downtime, WARRIOR was 
						reporting the last detected Alarm as the cause of downtime.
						This is not logical.  If a machine goes down, the cause of
						that is the FIRST thing that went wrong.  Everything that
						happens after that (subsequent faults before resuming an 
						OK / non-faulted state) are either caused by or are
						unavoidable in fixing the initial cause of Downtime.  For
						example, a machine jambup sensor may trip, indicating that
						material has jambed in the machine.  This fault may be present
						for only a moment, and then another 10 minutes of Downtime
						are experienced with the active alarm being an open emergency
						or safety door.  The cause of the open door is the operator
						had to open it to clear the jamb - so we should attribute it
						to the jambup!  Fixed.

						Added variable to WARRIOR global options file - allows the
						sysadmin to specify a minimum duration time for combinations
						of user + schedule + job number.  If a combination exists for
						less than minimum time variable, then that instance will not
						display in the GROSS THROUGHPUT report.  The data will still
						be used for the efficiency calculations, and it will show up
						in the CSV export of the GROSS THROUGHPUT report, but it
						won't display on the web-interface report.  Simply set to '0'
						to disable this option and show everything.

29	S.E.E.R. 2	1.5.3		n/a	Added ability to modify CORRECTIVE ACTION value after a run
						has been completed, from within report 2 (downtime analysis)
						if that report has been launched from within report 0 (the
						gross throughput report).  Restricted by Access Level.
						Also did some general tidy-ing up, and added occcurrance
						count / frequency count to downtime pareto charts.

30	S.E.E.R. 2	1.5.3		a	Bugfix for WARRIOR report 1 and 2, where duration longer than
						24 hours with shift = ALL or CUSTOM (jump from report 0) would
						result in erroneous output.
	
31	S.E.E.R. 2	1.5.3		b	Added ability to specify pen color by local instance for
						THINCHART.  Cleaned up some items to allow better skinning via
						plugins / themes.

32	S.E.E.R. 2	1.5.4		n/a	Added TTY PERFORMANCE MODEL to track performance of TTY
						type devices.  This will work well for barcode scanners,
						RFID readers, keyscan devices, some scales, or any other
						basic TTY device.  Displays a department monitor (hmi),
						runtime analysis (report) of fault conditions and bad
						output, and an individual item display (report).

33	S.E.E.R. 2	1.5.4		a	Bugfix for default 'config/advancedoptions_seer_0.php.DEFAULT'
						and 'globaloptions_seer_0.php.DEFAULT' where it could be a
						bit hectic for a first time administrator to discren a typo
						error that lead to a cyclical call / failure to load the
						full HMI.

						Added ability to give TouchPanel instances a friendly name,
						rather than only go by their MachineName (PanelName) for user
						display.  PanelName is still used for all of the nuts and
						bolts, we just change what the user is able to see.
						** helps with shitty OPC Servers that do not allow aliasing,
						or that have ugly tag beginnings.

						Enhancement (not really a bug, but 'feels' like one) to 
						TouchPanel such that if you are on any screen other than '0',
						you would be sent back to screen '0' when the page refreshed,
						which is terribly annoying.  Nested seer_PANEL_TO_USE variable
						such that it will pull from POST first, but if not available
						(like in the instance of a normal refresh), then it'll pull
						from GET, where the variable was added to the end of the
						Traffic COP string.

						Added 'ON_OFF_IND_TOGGLE_INVERSE' and 'ON_OFF_IND_INVERSE' to
						TOUCHPANEL.

						Moved to phpsysinfo version 3, as the 2.54 branch does not
						support modern Windows OS's (7 or Server 2008 and up), and
						is no longer supported by the project maintainers.

34 S.E.E.R. 2	1.6.0		Updated PHP code to comply with changes made in PHP7. This
						stable release has been built against Apache 2.4 and PHP 7 (VC14).
						The major changes here are in the php.ini and httpd.conf, but
						also in PHP's deprication of the MySQL API. It has been completely
						replaced with the MySQLi API. A pretty major change for a database 
						front end.

						Moved to phpsysinfo version 3.2.7

						Moved to wkhtmlpdf version 0.12.3.2

						Bug-patch where, if user pressed 'go' button without selecting a radial
						option (when a radial option is required), the thread would die and
						an error would be logged. Now, instead of dying, the page is simply
						reloaded and an error is logged saying the user attempted to run an
						empty query. If many errors of this nature are logged with the use of
						this release, a further update is planned to warn the user of his/her action
						and how to fix it.
